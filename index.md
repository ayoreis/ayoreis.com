# Hello, World!<br/>I am <strong>Ayo Reis</strong>.

I'm 16 and I like programming, open-source, plain text and Git, the internet and the web, drawing, making and learning.

**Right [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) I am:**

- Learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) to help spec and implement [URLPatternList](https://github.com/whatwg/urlpattern/issues/30) (in [Deno](https://deno.com)).
- Playing chess, [challenge me!](https://lichess.org/@/ayoreis).
- Reparing old HFS+ disks and writing a guide for others.
- Making an iOS client for [Syncthing](https://syncthing.new).
- Practising [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) and [touch typing](https://www.keybr.com).
- [Taking notes about all kinds of things I want to remember](https://github.com/ayoreis/notes).
- Planing a bike trip from [Cabo Carvoeiro to Tour Eiffel](https://www.facebook.com/events/679331994301485) with my dad.
